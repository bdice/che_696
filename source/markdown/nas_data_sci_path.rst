Introduction
------------

Mathematical foundations
++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Set theory and basic logic
- Multivariate thinking via functions and graphical displays
- Basic probability theory and randomness
- Matrices and basic linear algebra
- Networks and graph theory
- Optimization
- Partial derivatives (to understand interactions in a model)
- Advanced linear algebra (i.e., properties of matrices, eigenvalues, decompositions)
- “Big O” notation and analysis of algorithms
- Numerical methods (e.g., approximation and interpolation)

Computational Foundations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Basic abstractions
- Algorithmic thinking
- Programming concepts
- Data structures
- Simulations


Statistical Foundations
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- Variability, uncertainty, sampling error, and inference
- Multivariate thinking
- Nonsampling error, design, experiments (e.g., A/B testing), biases, confounding, and causal inference
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical modeling and model assessment
- Simulations and experiments


Data Management and Curation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Data provenance
- Data preparation, especially data cleansing and data transformation
- Data management (of a variety of data types)
- Record retention policies
- Data subject privacy
- Missing and conflicting data
- Modern databases


Data Description and Visualization
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Data consistency checking
- Exploratory data analysis
- Grammar of graphics,
- Attractive and sound static and dynamic visualizations
- Dashboards


Data Modeling and Assessment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Machine learning
- Multivariate modeling and supervised learning
- Dimension reduction techniques and unsupervised learning
- Deep learning
- Model assessment and sensitivity analysis
- Model interpretation (particularly for black box models)


Workflow and Reproducibility
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Workflows and workflow systems
- Reproducible analysis
- Documentation and code standards
- Source code (version) control systems
- Collaboration


Communication and Teamwork
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Ability to understand client needs
- Clear and comprehensive reporting
- Conflict resolution skills
- Well-structured technical writing without jargon
- Effective presentation skills.

Domain-Specific Considerations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

"Grounding data science instruction in substantive contextual examples (which will require the development of judgment and background in those areas) will help ensure that data scientists develop the capacity to pose and answer questions with data"

Ethical Problem Solving
+++++++++++++++++++++++

-﻿Ethical precepts for data science and codes of conduct
- Privacy and confidentiality
- Responsible conduct of research
- Ability to identify “junk” science
- Ability to detect algorithmic bias.

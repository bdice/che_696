Course description
------------------

Engineers are encountering and generating a ever-growing body of data and recognizing the utility of applying data science (DataSci) approaches to extract knowledge from that data. A common barrier to learning DataSci is the stack of prerequisite courses that cannot fit into the typical engineering student schedule. This class will remove this barrier by, in one semester, covering essential foundational concepts that are not part of many engineering disciplines’ core curricula. These include: good programming practices, data structures, linear algebra, numerical methods, algorithms, probability, and statistics. The class’s focus will be on how these topics relate to data science and to provide context for further self-study.

Topics
------

- One week intro to Bash/Python/vim/IDE (main ideas, then practice the rest of the semester)
    - Get students comfortable with pycharm and jupyter notebooks (they can proceed with either)
    - Enough of a foundation to be able to immediately use in the next week
    - Introduce libraries, including numpy, and numpy arrays
    - Installing and updating libraries (conda, pip)
- Two weeks on data structures (continuing intro python)
- Basic data types (integers, floats, lists, tuples, arrays, dictionaries)
- Tree, graphs (network X)
- Tie together how data structures are composed of other data structures (trees for sorted lists, keys on dicts, etc.)
- Debugging
- Timing (libraries versus writing own functions)
- Three weeks on basics of linear algebra/numerical methods
- Show how to solve by hand and using numpy libraries
- Matrix algebra
- Linear determinants
- Basic eigenvalue/eigenvector problems
- Two weeks on programming practices
- Versioning (git)
- Testing
- Modular programming
- Documentation
- Three weeks on algorithms (e.g. key topics from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
- Terminology: Big O notation, NP hard, etc.
- Sorting (as example)
- Searching/matching
- Graph processing
- String searching and manipulation
- Optimization methods
- Three weeks on probability and statistics
- Basics (terminology, notation, basic laws)
- Conditional probabilities and Bayesian statistics
- Discrete and continuous probability distributions
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, p-values and their controversial use, chi-squared tests)

    Program Core for UMich UG in DS
    • EECS 203 (4 credits): Discrete Mathematics. Acceptable alternative: Math 465.
    • EECS 280 (4 credits): Programming and Elementary Data Structures.
    • EECS 281 (4 credits): Data Structures and Algorithms.
    • STATS 412 (3 credits): Introduction to Probability and Statistics.
    • STATS 413 (4 credits): Applied Regression Analysis
    The above courses form the intellectual core of computing and statistics. These courses are necessary to provide a
    solid foundation for pursuing advanced technical courses in Data Science at 300-level and higher.
    • Every student in a Data Science program will take at least one course from each of the three following
    categories as part of the core requirements:
    o Machine learning and data mining elective: EECS 445 or STATS 415. Both these courses draw on
    techniques from statistics, computing, and linear algebra to provide a comprehensive introduction to
    machine learning and applications to a variety of domains. Credit is granted for only one course
    since the two courses have significant overlap in content.
    o Data management and applications elective: EECS 484 or EECS 485. These courses introduce the
    concept of databases, which are applicable to storing and querying large datasets.
    o Data science applications elective (3 credits): A student must take at least one upper-level course
    related to data science applications (e.g. computer vision, robotics, healthcare, biology, finance,
    chemistry, sensor-based systems, and security). Visit the DS-Eng website for the current list of
    approved courses that satisfy this requirement.

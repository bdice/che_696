    "## Why Jupyter notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks (formerly ipython notebooks) provide convenient platforms for getting to know python (or one of the other languages supported by them, including R and Julia--see FYI), especially for making and going through tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "*FYI*: The name Jupyter is an indirect acronyum of the three core languages it was designed for: JUlia, PYThon, and R and is inspired by the planet Jupiter.\n",

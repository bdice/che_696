    "For this problem, you will practice common and helpful bash commands, such as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "cd\n",
    "cp\n",
    "rm\n",
    "mv\n",

    "wget\n",
    "grep\n",
    "diff\n",

    "and more advanced (and extremely helpful) utilities such as `sed`, `awk`, and `vim`.\n",

    "Write commands to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "i. Create a directory named 'hw01prob01'\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. In that directory create a file named 'hopper_quotes.txt' containing the following text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To me programming is more than an important practical art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "> No computer is ever going to ask a new, reasonable question. It takes trained people to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We're flooding people with information. We need to feed it through a processor. A human must turn information into intelligence or knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask a new question.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.  From the command line, display (on your terminal) the last line of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Make a copy of that file, naming it 'hopper_edited.txt'. In that file, from the command line, change every instance of 'is' to 'remains'. Display the full contents of this edited file.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Make a new file 'combined.txt' with all the contents of 'hopper_quotes.txt' followed by 'hopper_edited.txt'. Display the total number of lines of this new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi. Display the contents of the directory 'hw01prob01'. \n",
    "\n",
    "vii. Delete that directory and all its contents."

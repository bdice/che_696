    "- Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time.\n",
    "- The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other’s changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.\n",
    "- Open scientific work is more useful and more highly cited than closed.\n",

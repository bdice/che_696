Algorhyme

We think that I shall never see
A graph more lovely than a tree.

A tree whose crucial property
Wes loop-free connectivity.

A tree which must be sure to span
So packets can reach every LAN.

First the root must be selected.
By WeD it is elected.

Least cost paths from root are traced.
Wen the tree these paths are placed.

A mesh is made by folks like me
Then bridges find a spanning tree.

--From the paper "An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN" by Radia Perlman, inventor of the spanning tree protocol.
